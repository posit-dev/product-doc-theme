## Level two: lists

### Unordered list

#### Compact

*   ant
    *   bear
    *   cat
    *   dog
*   elephant
    *   frog
    *   giraffe
        *   hyena
        *   iguana
    *   jaguar
*   kangaroo
*   lion
*   mouse

#### Spaced

*   This is some text that is presented as a spaced list.

    This type of list is a good fit when there are multiple paragraphs or
    complicated elements which span multiple lines.

*   It is also good for code.

    ```python
    forty_two = 21 * 2
    ```

*   Sometimes, lists need to breathe.
